# Alpine :: Mirror
Run an Alpine Mirror based on Alpine Linux. Small, lightweight, secure and fast üèîÔ∏è

The mirror will only cache the versions you specified during start or the folders which are present in /mirror/var. All others versions will be proxies to the default CDN.

## Volumes
* **/mirror/etc** - Directory of additional nginx configurations
* **/mirror/var** - Directory of all mirror data

## Run
```shell
docker run --name mirror \
  -v ../etc:/mirror/etc \
  -v ../var:/mirror/var \
  -d 11notes/alpine-mirror:[tag] \
    v3.16 \
    v3.17 \
    v3.18
```
